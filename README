AD9835_PSK31

By Thomas Krahn, KT5TK / DL4MDW (2012)

Simple 20m PSK31 beacon transmitting GPS coordinates 
using an ATMega328 and an AD9835 DDS

The circuit can be built from any Arduino and an AD9835 breakout board
like https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9169

Pinout:
LED_PIN 3 (This is not the usual Arduino LED because 13 is already used for SCK)

GPS_POWER_PIN 4  (Can be used to turn off the GPS to save power)
GPS_RESET_PIN 5  (Can be used to wake up the GPS properly after sleep mode)
  
SCLK     13      (aka SCK)
MISO     12      (not used)
SDATA    11      (aka MOSI)
SS       10      (not used)
FSYNC     9      (PORTB.1)
FSEL      8      (PORTB.0)
PSEL1     7      (PORTD.7)
PSEL0     6      (PORTD.6)

The serial pins TXD and RXD are connected (crossed over) to the GPS
I was using the GT-320FW High-Altitude GPS Receiver from Argentdata:
https://www.argentdata.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=144


GT-320FW
Pin	Color	Function
1	Yellow	TTL output
2	Blue	TTL input
3	White	RS-232 output
4	Green	RS-232 input
5	Red	    3.7-6v power
6	Black	Ground

The yellow wire from the GT-320FW needs to get connected to RX on the Arduino.
The blue wire is not neccesary.
Red & black can be powered through the Arduino 5V and GND pins

Note that the output is a little bit hard and needs passive filtering to reduce
spurs. I have used a little push-pull transistor amplifier to increase the power
from 10 mW to about 800 mW. http://www.sm0vpo.com:800/tx/qrp-hf1.htm

Power from 12 V solar panels was not stable enough to power up the whole unit.
It caused a significant frequency drift depending on illumination so that the 
PSK signal could not be decoded. Therefore I powered the AD9835 and the
ATMega by a 9V Energizer Advanced Lithium block and only the PA was powered by 
the solar cells.
